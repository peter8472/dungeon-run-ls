Show the memory usage of each character in your Dungeon Run save file

If you didn't notice, Dungeon Run has a little bug.  If your account's save file reaches about 64K, your game won't be saved.

Figuring out how to get the save file depends on your browser, but it is in the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools.
